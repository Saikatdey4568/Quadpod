## 🔥 Features & Capabilities  

### 🌄 **Traverses Uneven Terrains**  
🔹 **Quadpod can navigate rough and uneven surfaces** where wheeled robots struggle.  

### 🌊 **Mud Traversal**  
🔹 With **redundancy in movement**, Quadpod can **walk through muddy environments** with ease.  

### 🛠️ **Pipe Navigation**  
🔹 Quadpod exhibits **extra stability**, making it ideal for **navigating inside narrow pipes** where wheeled robots may fail.  

### 🧲 **Vertical Pipe Walking**  
🔹 Integrated **electromagnets** allow Quadpod to **walk on the walls of vertical pipes**, opening up new possibilities!  

### 🔎 **Underground Pipe Inspection**  
🔹 Quadpod is a **safer alternative to drones** for **inspecting underground pipes** without damaging the walls.  
🔹 It can perform **Ultrasonic Inspection** 🏗️ using **Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity (UPV) Tests**, which are **used by SPS for RCC water tank rehabilitation for Tata Group**.  

### 🛠️ **Ultrasonic Thickness (UT) Inspection**  
🔹 Quadpod can **measure pipe thickness** and **detect structural weaknesses**, making it valuable in **industrial maintenance**.
