Walking Robot using Inverse Kinematics

Quadpod is a project aimed at designing and developing a walking robot that utilizes the principle of inverse kinematics for locomotion. Unlike traditional wheeled robots, Quadpod offers several advantages:

- **Traverse Uneven Terrains:** Quadpod excels in traversing through uneven terrains where wheeled robots struggle to maneuver effectively.

- **Mud Traversal:** Its ultimate redundancy ability allows Quadpod to easily walk through muddy environments, a feat not achievable by wheeled robots.

- **Pipe Navigation:** Quadpod exhibits extra stability, making it suitable for navigating inside pipes where wheeled robots may face challenges.

- **Vertical Pipe Walking:** The integration of electromagnets enables Quadpod to walk on the walls of vertical pipes, expanding its range of applications.

- **Underground Pipe Inspection:** Quadpod's ability to navigate inside underground pipes makes it invaluable for inspection purposes. Unlike drones that can potentially cause damage to pipe walls, Quadpod offers a safer alternative. Additionally, it facilitates Ultrasonic Inspection using techniques like the Ultrasonic Pulse Velocity Test, a method utilized by SPS in the rehabilitation of RCC water tanks for Tata Group.

- **UT Inspection:** Quadpod can also perform Ultrasonic Thickness (UT) inspection within pipes, enhancing its utility in various industrial contexts.

By leveraging inverse kinematics and innovative design features, Quadpod offers unparalleled versatility and efficiency in robotic locomotion, making it suitable for a wide range of applications. 

Feel free to contribute to the project and explore its potential applications further!
